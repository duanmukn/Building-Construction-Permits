# Building-Construction-Permits

## Business Motivation
Zillow provides rent price index of every city in the United States, which indicates the rent price level in a city. However there's a latency, and the date does not reflects the current or near-future rent price index. This project is to use building construction and remodeling permit data to make fast and accurate prediction for the rent price level of a city, which is potentailly useful for apartment rental market.

## Data source
Rent index data is from Zillow.

The Department of Building and Safety issues permits for the construction, remodeling, and repair of buildings and structures in the City of Los Angeles. Permits are categorized into building permits, electrical permits, and mechanical permits. Depending on the complexity of a project, a permit may be issued the same day with Express Permit or e-Permit ("No Plan Check" category), or a permit may require that the plans be reviewed ("Plan Check" category) by a Building and Safety Plan Check personnel.

The permit data for most US cities is publicly accessible.
